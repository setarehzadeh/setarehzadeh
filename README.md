I’m a Data Analyst with over three years of experience helping organizations turn complex data into clear, actionable insights. My work focuses on building efficient data pipelines, automating reporting processes, and designing dashboards that support real business decisions.

I specialize in building structured data solutions; from cleaning and validating large datasets to designing automated reporting workflows that replace manual processes. I enjoy solving real business problems through data, whether that means improving data quality, developing scalable analytics pipelines, or delivering clear visual insights that leaders can act on with confidence.

My core strengths include:
  * **Data Analysis & Insights Generation:** turning raw data into meaningful business recommendations
  * **SQL & Data Pipelines:** writing efficient queries, transforming data, and optimizing reporting workflows
  * **Power BI & Data Visualization:** building interactive dashboards for performance monitoring and decision support
  * **Process Automation:** reducing manual work through scalable, reliable data solutions
  
I’ve worked with large, complex datasets across multiple business domains, collaborating with cross-functional teams to translate operational questions into measurable analytics. I’m passionate about continuous learning and building data solutions that create real impact.

On this GitHub, you’ll find projects focused on practical data analysis, reporting automation, and visualization. All designed to reflect real-world analytical thinking and business value.
